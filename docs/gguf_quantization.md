### Integration Plan Guideline

1. **Dependency Management**: Add the required dependency, such as `gguf`, to
   your project's `requirements.txt` or `setup.py`.

2. **Interface Module**: Create a Python module in your project, like
   `gguf_interface.py`, to serve as an intermediary between your project and
   `gguf`. This module will wrap the necessary `gguf` functionalities.

3. **API Enhancement**: Extend your project's API to include methods for
   exporting and importing models in the GGUF format. These methods should
   utilize the functions defined in `gguf_interface.py`.

4. **Conversion Script**: Develop a utility script or module that converts a
   model from your project's format to GGUF format using the `gguf` package.
   This conversion logic can be part of `gguf_interface.py`.

5. **Quantization Support**: If applicable, offer options in your project's API
   to allow users to specify the desired quantization level when converting to
   GGUF.

6. **Documentation and Examples**: Provide comprehensive documentation and
   examples to guide users on using the new features. Real-world use cases, such
   as converting a model to GGUF format, can be helpful for users.

### Code Snippet Example for gguf_interface.py:

```python
from gguf import GGUFWriter  # Assuming GGUFWriter is the class that writes GGUF files

def convert_to_gguf(model, bit_level=32, output_file='model.gguf'):
    # Extract weights and biases from the model
    weights = model.weights
    biases = model.biases

    # Initialize GGUF Writer
    gguf_writer = GGUFWriter(bit_level)

    # Add weights and biases to the GGUF file
    gguf_writer.add_weights(weights)
    gguf_writer.add_biases(biases)

    # Save the GGUF file
    gguf_writer.save(output_file)
```

This approach allows you to leverage `gguf` functionality while maintaining a
structured codebase that is adaptable for future updates or format changes.
